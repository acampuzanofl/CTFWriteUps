# Reverse Engineering
## Intro to Reversing 1
`Category:` Reverse Engineering  
`Difficulty:` Baby  
`Author:` 0x4d5a  
`First Blood:` bre_kit  

This is a introductory challenge for beginners which are eager to learn reverse engineering on linux. The three stages of this challenge will increase in difficulty. But for a gentle introduction, we have you covered: Check out the video of LiveOverflow or follow the authors step by step guide to solve the first part of the challenge.

### Reconnaissance
This is an entry level challenge, so we can start with some general analysis. Running `file`...

![](/CTFWriteUps/cscg2020/images/rev1file.png)  
`file` command outputs the possible file type, here it tells us that it's an elf file, a common Linux executable. Let's run it!

The program asks for a password and gives an error message when an invalid password is given. This is the first challenge so let's use a simple technique, `strings`...

![](/CTFWriteUps/cscg2020/images/rev1string.png)    
`strings` finds and prints all continuous sequences of at least 4 characters long. `strings` can be very powerful tool at finding references to important text in a file. In rev1, strings for the password prompt, failed input, error messages and a suspicious looking text that looks like a password `y0u_5h3ll_p455` were found.

Let's test this password out...

success! That was indeed the password, now we can get the flag from the server...

### Solution 
The program was a simple password check with no security. The password was hardcoded into the executable allowing us to parse the text from the file using `strings` command.  
flag = `CSCG{ez_pz_reversing_squ33zy}`
